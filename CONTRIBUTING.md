## How to contribute
### Did you find a bug?
**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching the Issues. If you're unable to find an
open issue addressing the problem. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much
relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating
the expected behavior that is not occurring. If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to
create the issue.
* Bug
* Security
* Documentation
* Generic

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue
  number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the Contributing guide to know more about coding conventions and
  benchmarks.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability,
functionality, or testability are great first tasks to work on when starting out and are always
welcome. 

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change with a new issue with the **feature** template, listen to feedback, and if it's
supported, start writing code.

### Coding Conventions
Follow conventions that already appear in the repository and feel free to ask for clarifications
about any conventions you don't understand.

**Thanks!**
